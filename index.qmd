> This collection of training materials is based on @grimm2020 and partly comprises the detailed descriptions provided in Appendix S1.

We expand on this material by providing tests and examples of the usage of ODD for different model types (i.e., not only individual-based models, but also data-driven and hybrid models). Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions about this material, or would like to contribute further.
