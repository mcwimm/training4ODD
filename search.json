    "text": "Welcome\nOpen Science is a collaborative culture that empowers the open sharing of data, information and knowledge within the scientific community and with the public, with the aim of accelerating scientific research and understanding. Its main goal is to make publicly funded scientific research transparent, accessible and reproducible. Do you already know the elements of Open Science (adopted from NASA)?\nThe FAIR guiding principles are part of them. FAIR stands for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Their implementation requires concepts (e.g., meta-data, open-access licences), technologies (e.g., specialized software), and repositories. Is our research already FAIR?\nThe Open Modelling Foundation (OMF), an international open science community that works to enable the next generation modeling of human and natural systems (HNS), targets on this issue. At the members council meeting in May 2025 in Boulder, the idea of proposing the so called ODD protocol as a general standard was generally approved.\nIts suitability to describe HNS models (any type of complex computational models developed for environmental systems) has still to be tested. Many parts of it will probably work well while others have to be adjusted. With this online tutorial, we want contribute to this process.",

We expand on this material by providing tests and examples of the usage of ODD for different model types (i.e., not only agent-based models, but also data-driven and hybrid models).\nThe tutorial goes sequentially through the three sections of the protocol: Overview, Design concepts and Details:\n\n\n\nStructure of the ODD protocol adapted after(R. Grimm V. 2020). The term model type was added in the overview since this meta-data is important for subsequent information.\n\n\nEach element of the main sections is addressed by a separate chapter.

To promote the application to HNS models in general, we tried to give also examples for other models types. Since our background is nevertheless domain specific, this did not work for all parts and we count on your feedback1 and contribution. Open Science is a community effort.

The mechanism driving the potential explanation is interaction among slow growth from feeding on invertebrates, rapid growth from cannibalism, and “gape limitation” which allows one fish to eat another only if the two fish are sufficiently different in size.\n\nDescription (“what is important of a specific observed case”, Arfaoui et al. 2014) .\n\nThe purpose of our model is to understand how different configurations in the policy design of REACH affect the dynamics of eco-innovation and shape market selection and innovation. In our model we take into account supplier–user interactions because they represent an essential element in the development of new technologies, particularly in the chemical industry. Additionally, some stylized facts that illustrate the competition between organic solvents and biosolvents in the surface treatment activity are considered. The objective is to examine to which extent different combinations of flexible and stringent instruments of REACH can lead to the development and diffusion of alternative solvents (biosolvents)\n\n\n\n1.4.2 … of Model Patterns\nQualitative patterns; vertical migration by Daphnia (Railsback, S. F. and B. C. Harvey. 2020)\n\nThe purpose of this model is to explain and understand diurnal vertical migration (VM) in zooplankton and how it interacts with a life history tradeoff, the allocation of mass to reproduction or growth. .. We evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce three patterns. The first two are of primary importance because they were observed in extensive laboratory experiments by Loose and Dawidowicz (1994) and appear driven directly by the risk-growth tradeoff (Figure 5.1)… Pattern 1: Response of VM to predation risk. ..

    "section": "1.6 Test yourself",
    "text": "1.6 Test yourself\n\nTask 1: Can you identify what is incorrect in the following description of a model’s purpose?\nThe model’s purpose is to explore the dynamics of forest ecosystems under climate change. We want to see how different species might respond and if there are any interesting feedback loops. The model considers various tree types, their growth, and competition for resources. We expect to see some changes in forest composition over time. This work is important for understanding ecological resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteHints\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what’s incorrect or could be improved in the example purpose statement, aligned with the guidance provided in Section 1.2:\n1. Lack of Specificity / “Explore” is too vague: The statement “to explore the dynamics of forest ecosystems” and “see how different species might respond” is a classic example of an imprecise purpose. It doesn’t state a clear question, hypothesis, or problem the model addresses. It’s an indication that the model might have been built without a sharp focus.\n2. Missing a Clear Question/Hypothesis: While it mentions “feedback loops,” it doesn’t pose a testable question like “To what extent do species-specific physiological adaptations to drought, combined with competitive interactions, influence the long-term carbon sequestration capacity of temperate forests under projected IPCC climate scenarios?”\n3. No Defined “Higher-Level Purpose”: Is it for prediction, explanation, description, or theoretical exposition? “Understanding ecological resilience” is a noble goal, but how does this specific model contribute to it? What kind of understanding will it generate?\n4. No Tie to Primary Results/Success Criteria: “We expect to see some changes in forest composition over time” is a vague outcome, not a specific criterion for success. How will the authors or readers judge if the model successfully explored or understood anything? What specific graphs or relationships would demonstrate this?\n5. No Testable Patterns: This is the most significant omission given the updated ODD. There are no specified patterns (observations, trends, general beliefs) that the model should reproduce to demonstrate its realism or utility. What specific changes in forest composition are expected based on empirical data or theory? How will “interesting feedback loops” be identified and verified?\n6. Describes the Model Prematurely: “The model considers various tree types, their growth, and competition for resources” starts to describe how the model works, which should be reserved for later sections (Entities, State Variables, Processes, etc.). The Purpose section should focus solely on the “why.”\n7. Not Specific to This Version: It doesn’t clearly delineate what this particular model aims to achieve versus potential future expansions.\n8. Ambiguous Terms: “Forest ecosystems,” “different species,” “various tree types,” and “ecological resilience” are all very broad. What specific types of forests, species, or aspects of resilience are being modeled?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nA significantly improved (but still hypothetical) version might be:\nThe purpose of this model is to test the hypothesis that increased frequency and intensity of drought events, driven by climate change, will lead to a shift in temperate forest composition from drought-sensitive coniferous species to more drought-tolerant deciduous species. Specifically, we aim to explain the observed pattern of increasing deciduous tree dominance in the Pacific Northwest region over the last two decades, and to predict the magnitude of this compositional shift by 2050 under IPCC RCP 8.5 climate projections. The model’s suitability will be evaluated by its ability to reproduce two key patterns: (1) the observed decline in average growth rates of Douglas Fir following historical drought years, and (2) the pattern of increased seedling establishment of Oak species in areas previously dominated by coniferous trees after severe droughts.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2: Which of the statements describes the observational patterns correctly?\n\n“The model shows the detection of daphnia kairomones which induces the VM to mimize predation risk.\n“The model reproduces the response of VM to predation risk”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) is correct. The model’s purpose is to explain the VM patterns using its mechanisms, but the patterns themselves are the observed phenomena.\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3: Select those specific purposes which are too vague and rewrite them (if the context allows you).\n\n\nThe model demonstrates a home range shrinking of caribou with decreasing food availability due to habitat shifts.\nTypical stem diameter distributions should be reproduced.\nThe model predicts the impact of sanitation felling on the spatial pattern on bark beetle infestion on spruce trees in the national park.\nThe model produces interesting results which are known from systems dynamics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nand 3. are clear enough to be included in the ODD.\nthe “typical diameter distribution” should be explicitly stated, e.g., “the J-shape distribution in the regeneration areas; the”u-shape distribution for the mature forest area”.\nSuch statements should be generally avoided.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGallagher, Cara A, Magda Chudzinska, Angela Larsen-gray, Christopher J Pollock, Sarah N Sells, Patrick J C White, and Uta Berger. 2021. “From Theory to Practice in Pattern-Oriented Modelling : Identifying and Using Empirical Patterns in Predictive Models.” Biological Reviews, 25. https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12729.",

Similarly, define how time is represented (discrete steps, continuous events) and the length/extent of time steps.\nAddress abstract/non-physical dimensions: If your model uses other abstract dimensions (e.g., socio-economic status as a dimension), describe them in the same way you would physical space.\nFor abstract models, provide conceptual scales: If your model doesn’t represent a specific real system, approximate or conceptually define your spatial and temporal scales (e.g., “grid cells are urban lots,” “time steps are the time for a family to sell a house”).\nFor variable scales, describe typical values: If your model can apply to systems with varying scales, state which scales are fixed versus variable, and provide typical ranges for the variable ones.\nProvide the rationale for scale choices: Justify why you chose particular spatial and temporal extents and resolutions, as these decisions can significantly impact model results.",

Note that the principles for describing these elements are largely consistent across various model types, whether agent-based, data-driven, or hybrid.\n\n2.4.0.1 Example descriptions of Entities\n\n[Knoeri C, Nikolic I, Althaus HJ, Binder CR. 2014. Enhancing recycling of construction materials…]\n\nThis example effectively shows how diverse entities (stakeholders, projects, grid cells, global environment) are defined and their roles explained within an ABM context.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.0.2 Example descriptions of State Variables\n\n[Railsback SF, Harvey BC, Ayllón D. InSTREAM 7 Model Description. Unpublished report.]\n\nThis example demonstrates the use of tables for clear, concise presentation of observer (global environment) and cell (spatial unit) state variables, including their types, units, and meanings. It highlights the crucial distinction between static and dynamic variables.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.0.3 Example descriptions of Scales\n\n[Railsback SF, Johnson MD. 2011. Pattern-oriented modeling of bird foraging and pest control in coffee farms…]\n\nThis example illustrates how to define spatial and temporal extent and resolution for an ecological ABM, including the important point about mixed time steps (e.g., 1-day step for general processes, but much shorter for specific agent behaviors like foraging).\n\n[Natalini D, Bravo G. 2014. Encouraging sustainable transport choices in American households…]\n\nThis example demonstrates the use of abstract or non-geographic dimensions (e.g., preference space with X, Y, Z coordinates for preferences) as “scales” within a social simulation model, showing how ODD can describe non-physical model spaces.\n\n[Polhill JG, Parker D, Brown D, Grimm V. 2008. Using the ODD protocol for describing three agent-based social simulation models of land-use change…]\n\nThis example shows how to describe scales for abstract models where absolute physical or temporal units are not fixed. It illustrates that even in abstract models, conceptual definitions of scales (e.g., grid cells as urban lots, time steps as “time for a family to sell a house”) are necessary.",

    "section": "2.5 Test yourself",
    "text": "2.5 Test yourself\nCan you identify what is incorrect or could be significantly improved in the following description of a model’s entities, state variables, and scales?\n\nOur model simulates a city. The entities are people, roads, and buildings. People have age, income, and a destination. Roads have length. Buildings have a type (residential, commercial). The model runs for 100 days, with each day being a time step. The city is a 100x100 grid where people move around. We also have a parameter for traffic congestion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExpand To See the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what’s incorrect or could be significantly improved in the example description:\n\nMissing Rationale for Entities: While the entities are listed, there’s no explanation of why these specific entities (people, roads, buildings) were chosen, or why other potential entities (e.g., vehicles, city government, businesses) were not included. The “Rationale” guidance states this is a fundamental design decision that needs justification.\nIncomplete State Variable Description:\n\nUnits and Range: For “age,” “income,” and “length” (of roads), units and typical ranges are missing. What are the units for income (e.g., dollars, thousands of dollars)? What’s the age range (0-100 years)?\nType: The “type” of variable (integer, float, boolean, text string) is not specified for any state variable.\nDynamic vs. Static: While “age” is implicitly dynamic, it’s not explicitly stated. Are road “length” and building “type” static or dynamic?\n“Destination” as a State Variable: While “destination” can be a state variable for a person, its representation isn’t clear (e.g., a coordinate, a building ID, a text string). It also hints at a behavior (moving to a destination) which starts to stray into Element 3.\n\nConfusion of Parameters with State Variables: “We also have a parameter for traffic congestion.” A parameter belongs in Element 7 (Submodels) where it’s used in an equation or algorithm, not here as a description of a part of the modeled world’s state. If “traffic congestion” is a dynamic characteristic of roads that changes during the simulation, it should be a state variable of the Road entity. If it’s a fixed value throughout the simulation, it’s a parameter. The current phrasing is ambiguous.\nMissing Rationale for Scales: The spatial and temporal scales are stated (“100 days,” “100x100 grid”), but there’s no justification for why these specific scales were chosen. Why 100 days? Why a 100x100 grid? What real-world area does 100x100 grid represent? (e.g., “each grid cell represents 100m x 100m, representing a total area of 100 km²”). This justification is crucial for scientific rigor.\nLack of Detail on Spatial Representation: “The city is a 100x100 grid where people move around” is too brief. Is it discrete (cells) or continuous? Is it toroidal (wraps around) or bounded? These details are important for reproducibility.\n“People move around” - Describing Behavior: Similar to “destination,” this phrase hints at model processes, which should be avoided in Element 2. The purpose of Element 2 is to describe what exists, not what happens.\n\nA significantly improved (but still hypothetical) version might be:\n\nThe entities in this model are People, Roads, and Buildings. People are included to represent the individual decision-makers whose movements influence traffic patterns. Roads and Buildings are included as essential environmental structures that constrain and facilitate movement within the city. Other potential entities, such as vehicles or specific businesses, were omitted to maintain model simplicity and focus on emergent traffic patterns from individual routing choices. * People (agents): * age: Integer, years [0-100]. Dynamic. * income: Float, thousands of USD/year [0-500]. Dynamic. * current_location: Coordinate pair (x, y) on grid. Dynamic. * daily_destination: Coordinate pair (x, y) on grid. Dynamic. * Roads (static environmental entities): * segment_length: Float, meters [10-500]. Static. * traffic_flow: Integer, vehicles/hour [0-2000]. Dynamic. * road_type: Text string {“arterial”, “local”}. Static. * Buildings (static environmental entities): * building_id: Integer. Static. * building_type: Text string {“residential”, “commercial”, “public”}. Static. * occupancy_status: Boolean {TRUE, FALSE}. Dynamic. The model represents a 2D spatial extent of 10x10 km, modeled as a 100x100 discrete grid of square cells, where each cell represents 100x100 meters. The spatial boundaries are bounded (no toroidal wrapping) to simulate a finite urban area. The temporal scale is represented by discrete time steps, with each time step representing 1 hour. Simulations run for a total temporal extent of 2400 hours (100 days). These scales were chosen to capture diurnal commuting patterns within a medium-sized urban area and to allow for sufficient simulation time for traffic congestion patterns to emerge and stabilize.",

    "text": "3.2 Guidance\nEffectively describing your model’s processes and scheduling is paramount for its reproducibility and comprehensibility. Keep the following in mind:\n\nBe complete but concise: Your schedule should include everything that is executed each time step. However, it should remain an overview. For complex processes, simply state which “submodel” (fully detailed in Element 7) is executed, without going into its internal logic here. Very simple processes can be fully described in this section.\nPrioritize clarity of execution order: For actions performed by multiple entities (e.g., all agents), clearly state the order of execution (e.g., arbitrary, random, sorted by a state variable). Scheduling decisions can have strong effects on model results and require careful justification.\nExplicitly state state variable updates: The core purpose of model processes is to change state variables. For each action, identify which state variables are updated.\nProvide rationale for processes and scheduling: Explain why you chose to include specific processes and exclude others. Crucially, justify why actions are scheduled in a particular order, especially when it’s not self-evident. This transparency makes your model design less arbitrary.\nSeparate continuous time events (if applicable): If your model includes actions scheduled as discrete events in continuous time (rather than discrete time steps), summarize how these events are scheduled (what triggers them, how their timing is determined). Full details are still reserved for Element 7.\nUse pseudo-code or diagrams (judiciously): While a simple numbered list of actions is often sufficient, more complex logic or scheduling might benefit from pseudo-code or flowcharts. However, these should supplement, not replace, the clear textual description, as diagrams alone are rarely sufficient for full reproducibility. Avoid actual programming code.\nDo not include time step length or temporal extent: These aspects belong in Element 2 (Entities, State Variables, and Scales), as they define the overall model world, not the internal operations per step.",

    "text": "3.5 Test Yourself\nCan you identify what is incorrect or could be significantly improved in the following description of a model’s process overview and scheduling?\n\nEach day, the agents decide where to go, then they move. Next, the environment updates based on their movement. We also collect data at the end of the simulation. This process is repeated until the simulation ends. We didn’t specify the order for agent movement because it doesn’t really matter for our results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionExpand To See the Solution\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a breakdown of what’s incorrect or could be significantly improved in the example description:\n\nVague Process Names/Submodels: “Decide where to go,” “they move,” and “environment updates” are too generic. While full detail is in Element 7, the overview should use more descriptive “submodel” names (e.g., “Agent_Decision_Submodel,” “Agent_Movement_Submodel,” “Environment_Update_Submodel”).\nMissing State Variable Updates: The description states what happens but fails to explicitly mention which state variables are updated by each action. For example:\n\n“Agents decide where to go” should lead to an update of the agent’s daily_destination state variable.\n“They move” updates the agent’s current_location state variable.\n“Environment updates based on their movement” might update the traffic_flow state variable of Roads or occupancy_status of Buildings. This is a critical omission for reproducibility.\n\nIncorrect Placement of Data Collection/Output: “We also collect data at the end of the simulation.” Data collection and output (what ODD calls “Observation” under Design Concepts) typically occur within each time step, after all relevant processes have run, to capture the system’s state. Describing it as only happening “at the end of the simulation” implies it’s not part of the daily schedule, which is often inaccurate for ABMs. Even if output is only saved at the very end, how the data points themselves are generated or “observed” from the model state usually happens within the simulation loop.\nInsufficient Rationale for Execution Order: The statement “We didn’t specify the order for agent movement because it doesn’t really matter for our results” is a common trap. While it might be true that the order doesn’t matter, it needs to be explicitly stated and justified (e.g., “Agents update their location in arbitrary order, as their movement decisions are independent and do not affect the choices of other agents within the same time step”). This justification prevents assumptions and aids reproducibility. If the order could matter but the model implicitly assumes it doesn’t (e.g., synchronous updating where interactions are resolved after all agents have acted), that still needs to be clearly stated.\nMissing Handling of Multi-Entity Action Order: “The agents decide where to go, then they move.” For actions performed by all agents, the internal order (e.g., random, sorted by age, arbitrary) must be specified, even if the modeler believes it doesn’t matter. This is a crucial detail for reproducibility.\nVague Loop Condition: “This process is repeated until the simulation ends” is implied by Element 2’s scales, but the schedule itself should be precise. For instance, “These actions are repeated for 100 time steps.”\n\nA significantly improved (but still hypothetical) version might be:\n\nEach time step (representing one hour, as defined in Element 2), the following actions are executed in this precise order: 1. Environment_Update_Submodel: The environment updates its traffic_flow state variables for all Road entities based on the previous hour’s agent movements. This update occurs first to provide current traffic conditions for agent decisions. 2. Agent_Decision_Submodel: All People agents simultaneously (arbitrary order) execute their decision submodel, updating their daily_destination state variable for the current time step. The order is arbitrary as agents make decisions based on perceived, not actual, real-time traffic updates. 3. Agent_Movement_Submodel: All People agents execute their movement submodel, updating their current_location state variable. The order in which agents attempt to move is randomized each time step to avoid artifacts from fixed processing order when multiple agents might compete for the same grid cell or road segment. 4. Observation_Submodel: The model’s observer collects aggregated data on current_location for all People and traffic_flow for all Roads, writing these to an output file. This ensures a consistent snapshot of the system state at the end of each time step. These actions are repeated for the total simulation duration of 100 days (2400 time steps), as defined in Element 2.",
