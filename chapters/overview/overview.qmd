## Why

The section ***Overview*** of the ODD protocol provides the **meta-data of the model**. Based on them, readers should be able to decide quickly whether the model is relevant to their research question(s) and whether they can learn from it, use it, or reuse parts of it.

## Elements

The *Overview* provides all relevant information for this decision, but in a small amount. It contains three paragraphs:

-   **Purpose, patterns and model type**[^overview-1]: state the specific purpose(s) for which the model was developed, and the empirical observations (i.e. patterns) believed to be driven by the processes, variables, etc. described by the model.

-   **Entities, state variables and scales**: describe the objects or actors that behave as a unit in the model, the attributes of each kind of entity and the spatial and temporal scales represented.

-   **Process overview and scheduling**: A brief summary of the processes executed by the model and the order in which they are executed.

[^overview-1]: We added *model type* here. We consider it important since it determines the subsections of the ODD protocol.

## Pitfalls

The *Overview* contains often

-   information about research goals which the developers will address in the future, but the present version of the model is not ready for it.
-   too many details, e.g. how particular processes are described or how the state variables are updated.

All this is irrelevant for the decision whether the model is suitable or not for the own purpose. This becomes only interesting once the reader is willing to move on to the subsequent chapters of the ODD.

## Key takeaway

The *Overview* contains the meta-data of your model only. The information provided should be technical rather than narrative. A reader wants to decide quickly whether your model is useful for his/her own needs and further read is worth.
