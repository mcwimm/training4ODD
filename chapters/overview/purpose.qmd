# Purpose

## Idea

::: callout-tip
### TL;DR – Purpose:

Describes why the model was developed: What question, hypothesis, or problem does it address? Is it exploratory, explanatory, or predictive? What are the main processes it tries to capture?

The purpose defines the model’s role in the research — its "why".
:::

Every model has to start from a clear question, problem, or hypothesis; readers cannot understand your model unless they understand its purpose. Therefore, ODD starts with a concise and specific statement of the purpose(s) for which the model was developed. The examples of Element 1 we provide below categorize model purposes into types of general purpose (e.g., prediction, explanation, description, theoretical exposition, illustration, analogy, and social learning). It is useful to first identify one or more of these general types of model purpose before stating the specific purpose. The “patterns” part of this element is new in this version of ODD. It helps clarify the model purpose by specifying the criteria you will use to decide when your model is realistic enough to be useful for its purpose. The patterns are observations, at the individual or system level, that are believed to be driven by the same processes, variables, etc. that are important for the model’s purpose. For some of the possible purposes, the model will be assumed useful only if it can reproduce the patterns. For other purposes, not reproducing the patterns can be an important result because it indicates that some mechanism is missing or inadequately represented, ultimately indicating how important these are. These patterns can be observations from the real system being modeled, obtained from data or literature. For models not based on a specific real system, the patterns are often general beliefs about how the system and its agents should behave. Including patterns in ODD is also a way to link it explicitly to “pattern-oriented modeling”, a set of strategies for designing and evaluating ABMs; this link is explained in the main text and by Railsback and Grimm (2019).

## Guidance

**Make the purpose specific, addressing a clear question.** The purpose statement should be specific enough to enable a reader to independently judge a model’s success at achieving this purpose as well as to serve as the primary “filter” for what is and is not in the model: ideally the model should only include entities and mechanisms that are necessary to meet its purpose. If the purpose statement is only general and unspecific, and especially if it lacks patterns for evaluating the model’s usefulness, then it will be difficult to justify (and make) model design decisions. Some ODDs state only that the model’s purpose is to “explore,” “investigate,” or “study” some system or phenomenon, which is not specific enough to assess the model or to determine what the model needs to contain. An imprecise purpose such as this is often an indication that the modeler simply assembled some mechanisms in an ABM and explored its results. Studies like this can be made more scientific by stating the purpose as a clear question such as “To test whether the mechanisms A, B, and C can explain the observed phenomena X, Y, and Z.”

**Include the higher-level purpose**. The purpose statement should also clarify the model’s higher-level purpose: whether it is to develop understanding of the system, or to make specific predictions, etc. Different high-level purposes lead to different model designs. Use the general purposes from the examples of Element 1 we provide below as a guide.

**Tie the purpose to the study’s primary results.** One way to make this statement of model purpose specific enough is to explicitly consider what point you are trying to demonstrate with the model. The statement should allow the readers to clearly judge the extent to which the model is successful. This is closely related to the primary analysis you will conduct with the model. Think about the key graph(s) you will produce in your “Results” section, where you apply the model to your main research question. The model’s purpose should include producing the relationship shown in this graph.

**Define your terms.** If you state that your model’s purpose is (for example) to “predict how the vulnerability of a community to flooding depends on public policy”, you still have not stated a clear model purpose. The term “vulnerability to flooding” could mean many things: drowning, travel delays, property damage, etc.; and “public policy” could refer to zoning, insurance, or emergency response. Be clear about exactly what inputs and results your model addresses.

**Be specific to this version of the model.** To keep the description clear and focused, do not discuss potential future modifications of the model to new purposes or patterns. (Future plans might be described instead in the Discussion section of a publication.) However, if the same model is designed for multiple purposes, those purposes should be described even if they are not addressed in the current publication.

**Do not describe the model yet.** Authors are often tempted to start describing how the model works here in the purpose statement, which is a mistake. Instead, address only the purpose here and then, in subsequent sections, you can tie the model’s design to the purpose by explaining why specific design decisions were necessary for the model’s purpose.

**Make this purpose statement independent.** Model descriptions are typically published in research articles or reports that also include, in their introduction, a statement of the study’s purpose. This ODD element should be independent of any presentation of study purpose elsewhere in the same document, for several reasons: (a) an ODD description should always be complete and understandable by itself, and (b) re-stating the model purpose as specifically as possible always helps modelers (and readers) clarify what should be in the model.

**Use qualitative but testable patterns.** Patterns useful for designing and evaluating ABMs are often general (observed at multiple locations or times) and qualitative. However, using patterns to evaluate a model requires that they be testable: you need a reproducible way to determine whether the model matches the pattern. Making patterns testable can be as simple as stating them as qualitative trends, e.g., that output X increases as variable A decreases. We generally discourage statistical definitions of patterns where the pattern is, in fact, qualitative. There are more appropriate ways of formalizing qualitative patterns, e.g. Thorngate and Edmonds (2013).

**Document the patterns.** A complete description of the patterns used in modeling needs to document why the patterns were selected: what evidence supports them, and what is their role in justifying the purpose? Documenting patterns can range from simply stating them as widespread (or your own) beliefs, to citing multiple empirical studies that observed each pattern. Thorough documentation of several patterns can require substantial text, which could conflict with keeping this “Overview” part of ODD short. In this case, patterns can be thoroughly documented in a separate section of a report or article and summarized in the ODD description; thorough documentation of the patterns in the ODD description is not essential for it to be complete enough to make the model reproducible.

## Checklist

The ODD text for this element should describe: • The model’s specific purpose(s). • The patterns used as criteria for evaluating the model’s suitability for its purpose.

## Examples of Model Purpose

These examples are organized by the seven general model purposes identified by Edmonds et al. (2019. Different modelling purposes. Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 22:6; http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/22/3/6.html). The definitions of these purposes is quoted from Edmonds et al. (This does not list all possible purposes but includes the relevant kinds for the vast majority of academic model published.)

Example purpose of *prediction* (“to reliably anticipate well-defined aspects of data that is not currently known to a useful degree of accuracy via computations using the model”): \[Carter N, Levin SA, Barlow A, Grimm V. 2015. Modeling tiger population and territory dynamics using an agent-based approach. Ecological Modelling 312: 347-362\]

> The proximate purpose of the model is to predict the dynamics of the number, location, and size of tiger territories in response to habitat quality and tiger density… The ultimate purpose of the model,

Example purpose of *explanation* (“establishing a possible causal chain from a set-up to its consequences in terms of the mechanisms in a simulation”):

\[The Simplified Fish Cannibalism Model; unpublished description by SF Railsback of a model based on that of: DeAngelis DL, Cox DK, and Coutant CC. 1980. Cannibalism and size dispersal in young-of-the-year largemouth bass: experiment and model. Ecological Modelling 8:133-48.\]

> The purpose of this model is to illustrate a potential explanation for how small changes in the initial size distribution and growth of a cohort of cannibalistic fish can produce large differences in later size distribution, an example of how positive feedback can cause rapid divergence within a system. The mechanism driving the potential explanation is interaction among slow growth from feeding on invertebrates, rapid growth from cannibalism, and “gape limitation” which allows one fish to eat another only if the two fish are sufficiently different in size.

Example purpose of *description* (“to partially represent what is important of a specific observed case (or small set of closely related cases)”):

\[Arfaoui N, Brouillat E, Saint Jean M. 2014. Policy design and technological substitution: Investigating the REACH regulation in an agent-based model. Ecological Economics 107: 347- 365\]

> The purpose of our model is to understand how different configurations in the policy design of REACH affect the dynamics of eco-innovation and shape market selection and innovation. In our model we take into account supplier–user interactions because they represent an essential element in the development of new technologies, particularly in the chemical industry. Additionally, some stylized facts that illustrate the competition between organic solvents and biosolvents in the surface treatment activity are considered. The objective is to examine to which extent different combinations of flexible and stringent instruments of REACH can lead to the development and diffusion of alternative solvents (biosolvents)

## Examples of Model Patterns

Model patterns are essentially the *benchmarks* or *phenomena* from the real world (or from well-established theory) that your model should be able to reproduce if it is indeed capturing the essential mechanisms relevant to its purpose. If your model fails to reproduce an expected pattern, it signals that something crucial might be missing or misrepresented in its design. Conversely, successfully reproducing patterns increases confidence in the model's underlying logic and its ability to address its stated purpose. The “patterns” part of Element 1 is new in this version of ODD. Therefore, only a few ODD documents include it.

\[Model of vertical migration by Daphnia. Section 5.5 of: Railsback, S. F. and B. C. Harvey. 2020. Modeling populations of adaptive individuals. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.\]

> The purpose of this model is to explain and understand diurnal vertical migration (VM) in zooplankton and how it interacts with a life history tradeoff, the allocation of mass to reproduction or growth. The model is based explicitly on the cladoceran Daphnia magna (which we refer to simply as Daphnia). We evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce three patterns. The first two are of primary importance because they were observed in extensive laboratory experiments by Loose and Dawidowicz (1994) and appear driven directly by the risk-growth tradeoff (Figure 5.1)… Pattern 1: Response of VM to predation risk. This pattern reflects how daphnia VM in the laboratory changed as the perceived risk of predation by fish increased. In the laboratory experiments, perceived risk was increased by adding fish kairomones—chemicals produced by fish that daphnia can use to sense fish density—and perceived risk was quantified as fish concentration (fish/L). With no perceived risk, daphnia stayed near the surface throughout the diurnal cycle. At low fish concentrations, daphnia remained near the surface or migrated only to shallow depths. With high risk, daphnia stayed near the bottom. But at intermediate risk, daphnia exhibited VM, with their mean elevation in the water column low during the day and rising toward the surface at night. And at the lowest fish concentration producing VM, daphnia did not begin migration until growing to a threshold body size. Pattern 2. Selection of slightly shallower depths with low food. Under high perceived risk of fish predation, a decrease in food availability resulted in daphnia selecting shallower depths. However, this change in elevation was small and occurred only in daytime. Pattern 3. Response of reproductive allocation to predation risk. Under low or absent perceived fish predation risk, the daphnia in Fiksen’s model initially allocated almost all their assimilated mass to growth instead of reproduction. This allocation let them reach maximum size quickly and switch to high reproductive output. At higher risk, the daphnia allocated some mass to reproduction from the start, producing some offspring before reaching maximum size. However, at very high risk the daphnia fed very little, grew slowly, and allocated only a moderate fraction of mass to reproduction…

### Key takeaways

1.  **They are Observations, Not Mechanisms:** Notice that the patterns describe *what is observed*, not *how it happens*. For instance, "Response of VM to predation risk" describes a behavior, not the detailed physiological process of how daphnia detect kairomones. The model's purpose is to *explain* these patterns using its mechanisms, but the patterns themselves are the observed phenomena.

2.  **Qualitative but Testable:** As emphasized in the guidance, these patterns are often qualitative (e.g., "daphnia stayed near the surface," "migrated only to shallow depths," "stayed near the bottom," "exhibited VM"). However, they are described with enough detail and context (e.g., "as the perceived risk of predation by fish increased," "at low fish concentrations," "at intermediate risk") to make them *testable*. You can run the model under analogous conditions and check if its output matches the described qualitative trend. This avoids the trap of vague statements like "the model should produce interesting results."

3.  **Multiple Patterns for Robustness:** The *Daphnia* example presents three distinct patterns. This highlights a best practice: relying on multiple patterns to constrain and validate a model. A model that reproduces several independent patterns is generally more robust and credible than one that only matches a single pattern. Each pattern offers a different "angle" for evaluating the model's realism.

4.  **Context and Source:** The examples provide context (e.g., "observed in extensive laboratory experiments by Loose and Dawidowicz (1994)") for the patterns. This is crucial for transparency and reproducibility. It tells the reader where the pattern comes from and why it is considered a valid benchmark.

5.  **Hierarchy of Importance (Optional but useful):** In the *Daphnia* example, the authors explicitly state that "The first two are of primary importance." This can be helpful if some patterns are more central to the model's core purpose or represent stronger empirical evidence than others.

6.  **Connection to "Pattern-Oriented Modeling" (POM):** The section implicitly links to POM, a set of strategies for designing and evaluating ABMs where models are iteratively refined by their ability to reproduce observed patterns. By providing examples, it helps users understand how to apply POM principles to their own model development and documentation, reinforcing the idea that **patterns are not just for verification, but also for guiding model design**.

In summary, this section provides tangible blueprints for how to articulate the empirical or theoretical benchmarks against which your model's output will be compared. These examples are crucial for helping users transform the abstract concept of "purpose" into a concrete, verifiable set of criteria for model success.

## Test yourself

**Can you identify what is incorrect in the following description of a model's purpose?**

> The model's purpose is to explore the dynamics of forest ecosystems under climate change. We want to see how different species might respond and if there are any interesting feedback loops. The model considers various tree types, their growth, and competition for resources. We expect to see some changes in forest composition over time. This work is important for understanding ecological resilience.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Expand To See the Solution

Here’s a breakdown of what’s incorrect or could be improved in the example purpose statement, aligned with the guidance provided in Section 1.2:

**1. Lack of Specificity / "Explore" is too vague:** The statement "to explore the dynamics of forest ecosystems" and "see how different species might respond" is a classic example of an imprecise purpose. It doesn't state a clear question, hypothesis, or problem the model addresses. It's an indication that the model might have been built without a sharp focus.\
**2. Missing a Clear Question/Hypothesis:** While it mentions "feedback loops," it doesn't pose a testable question like "To what extent do species-specific physiological adaptations to drought, combined with competitive interactions, influence the long-term carbon sequestration capacity of temperate forests under projected IPCC climate scenarios?"

**3. No Defined "Higher-Level Purpose":** Is it for prediction, explanation, description, or theoretical exposition? "Understanding ecological resilience" is a noble goal, but how does this specific model contribute to it? What kind of understanding will it generate?

**4. No Tie to Primary Results/Success Criteria:** "We expect to see some changes in forest composition over time" is a vague outcome, not a specific criterion for success. How will the authors or readers judge if the model successfully explored or understood anything? What specific graphs or relationships would demonstrate this?

**5. No Testable Patterns:** This is the most significant omission given the updated ODD. There are no specified patterns (observations, trends, general beliefs) that the model should reproduce to demonstrate its realism or utility. What specific changes in forest composition are expected based on empirical data or theory? How will "interesting feedback loops" be identified and verified?

**6. Describes the Model Prematurely:** "The model considers various tree types, their growth, and competition for resources" starts to describe how the model works, which should be reserved for later sections (Entities, State Variables, Processes, etc.). The Purpose section should focus solely on the "why."

**7. Not Specific to This Version:** It doesn't clearly delineate what this particular model aims to achieve versus potential future expansions.

**8. Ambiguous Terms:** "Forest ecosystems," "different species," "various tree types," and "ecological resilience" are all very broad. What specific types of forests, species, or aspects of resilience are being modeled?

A significantly improved (but still hypothetical) version might be:

> The purpose of this model is to test the hypothesis that increased frequency and intensity of drought events, driven by climate change, will lead to a shift in temperate forest composition from drought-sensitive coniferous species to more drought-tolerant deciduous species. Specifically, we aim to explain the observed pattern of increasing deciduous tree dominance in the Pacific Northwest region over the last two decades, and to predict the magnitude of this compositional shift by 2050 under IPCC RCP 8.5 climate projections. The model's suitability will be evaluated by its ability to reproduce two key patterns: (1) the observed decline in average growth rates of Douglas Fir following historical drought years, and (2) the pattern of increased seedling establishment of Oak species in areas previously dominated by coniferous trees after severe droughts.
