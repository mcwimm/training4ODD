# Purpose

::: callout-tip
### TL;DR – The Purpose includes

-   What question, hypothesis, or **problem** does it address? .. but also for what was it not developed!
-   Is it exploratory, explanatory, or predictive?
-   Which **patterns** should be reproduced by the model to evaluate its suitability for the purpose?
-   To which general **type** belongs this model?

The purpose defines the model’s role in the research — its "why", "focus" and "approach".
:::

## Idea

ODD starts with a concise and specific statement of the purpose(s) for which the model was developed. This should be a clear question, problem, or hypothesis. The purpose assigns your model to a **general purpose first**, e.g.

-   prediction
-   explanation
-   description
-   theoretical exposition
-   illustration
-   analogy
-   social learning
-   ...

**Identify one or more of these categories before you state the specific purpose of your model.**

For most **specific purposes**, the model will be assumed useful only if it can **reproduce observational patterns**. They occur at the individual or system level; and are believed to be driven by the same processes, variables, etc. that the model considers. Not reproducing patterns can also be an important result because it indicates that some processes are missing or inadequately represented. **Specify the patterns you will use as criteria to decide whether your model is useful for its purpose.**

## Where do you find these patterns?

Patterns can be observations from the real system being modeled, obtained from data or literature. For models not based on a specific real system, the patterns are often general beliefs about how the system and its agents should behave. You find a very good overview about empirical patterns useful for predictive models here: [@gallagher2021]

## Guidance

**The purpose**

-   addresses a clear question.
-   is specific enough to enable a reader to judge the model’s success at achieving its purpose.
-   serves as the primary “filter” for what is and is not in the model[^purpose-1].

[^purpose-1]: Ideally the model should only include entities and mechanisms that are necessary to meet its purpose.

### Pitfalls

An imprecise purpose is often an indication that the modeler simply assembled some mechanisms in an ABM and explored its results. Studies like this can be made more scientific by stating the purpose as a clear question such as “To test whether the mechanisms A, B, and C can explain the observed phenomena X, Y, and Z.”

## Examples ...

### ... of Model Purposes

**Specific model purposes** assigned to three **general purposes** identified by Edmonds et al. (2019):

::: panel-tabset
#### Prediction

**Prediction** ("data that is not currently known to a useful degree of accuracy via computations using the model", Carter et al. 2015)

*The proximate purpose of the model is to predict the dynamics of the number, location, and size of tiger territories in response to habitat quality and tiger density… The ultimate purpose of the model, ???*

#### Explanation

**Explanation** ("find a possible causal chain from a set-up to its consequences ", after DeAngelis et al. 1980)

*The purpose of this model is to illustrate a potential explanation for how small changes in the initial size distribution and growth of a cohort of cannibalistic fish can produce large differences in later size distribution, an example of how positive feedback can cause rapid divergence within a system. The mechanism driving the potential explanation is interaction among slow growth from feeding on invertebrates, rapid growth from cannibalism, and “gape limitation” which allows one fish to eat another only if the two fish are sufficiently different in size.*

#### Description

**Description** (“what is important of a specific observed case”, Arfaoui et al. 2014) .

*The purpose of our model is to understand how different configurations in the policy design of REACH affect the dynamics of eco-innovation and shape market selection and innovation. In our model we take into account supplier–user interactions because they represent an essential element in the development of new technologies, particularly in the chemical industry. Additionally, some stylized facts that illustrate the competition between organic solvents and biosolvents in the surface treatment activity are considered. The objective is to examine to which extent different combinations of flexible and stringent instruments of REACH can lead to the development and diffusion of alternative solvents (biosolvents)*

### ... of Model Patterns

::: panel-tabset
#### Qualitative patterns

**Qualitative patterns**; vertical migration by Daphnia (Railsback, S. F. and B. C. Harvey. 2020)

*The purpose of this model is to explain and understand diurnal vertical migration (VM) in zooplankton and how it interacts with a life history tradeoff, the allocation of mass to reproduction or growth. .. We evaluate our model by its ability to reproduce three patterns. The first two are of primary importance because they were observed in extensive laboratory experiments by Loose and Dawidowicz (1994) and appear driven directly by the risk-growth tradeoff (Figure 5.1)… Pattern 1: Response of VM to predation risk. .. Pattern 2. Selection of slightly shallower depths with low food. ... Pattern 3. Response of reproductive allocation to predation risk. …*

::: {.dg-box .dg-box--border-left}
## Key takeaways

1.  **Patterns are observations not Mechanisms:** they describe *what is observed*, not *how it happens*.

2.  **Qualitative should be testable:** described them with enough detail and context. Run the model under analogous conditions and check if its output matches the described trend(s).

3.  **Multiple Patterns for Robustness:** a model that reproduces several independent patterns is generally more robust and credible than one that only matches a single pattern.

4.  **Context and Source:** is crucial for transparency, reproducibility and benchmarking. e.g, "observed in laboratory experiments by Loose and Dawidowicz (1994)").

5.  **Hierarchy of Importance (Optional but useful):** see *Daphnia* example "The first two are of primary importance." This helps to tie the results to the model's core purpose or represent stronger empirical evidence than others.

6.  **Connection to "Pattern-Oriented Modeling" (POM):** POM is an established strategy for designing and evaluating ABMs. Patterns **are not just for verification, but also for guiding model design** (please check XXX).

## Test yourself

::::: dg-box
**Task 1: Can you identify what is incorrect in the following description of a model's purpose?**

The model's purpose is to explore the dynamics of forest ecosystems under climate change. We want to see how different species might respond and if there are any interesting feedback loops. The model considers various tree types, their growth, and competition for resources. We expect to see some changes in forest composition over time. This work is important for understanding ecological resilience.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Hints

Here’s a breakdown of what’s incorrect or could be improved in the example purpose statement, aligned with the guidance provided in Section 1.2:

**1. Lack of Specificity / "Explore" is too vague:** The statement "to explore the dynamics of forest ecosystems" and "see how different species might respond" is a classic example of an imprecise purpose. It doesn't state a clear question, hypothesis, or problem the model addresses. It's an indication that the model might have been built without a sharp focus.\
**2. Missing a Clear Question/Hypothesis:** While it mentions "feedback loops," it doesn't pose a testable question like "To what extent do species-specific physiological adaptations to drought, combined with competitive interactions, influence the long-term carbon sequestration capacity of temperate forests under projected IPCC climate scenarios?"

**3. No Defined "Higher-Level Purpose":** Is it for prediction, explanation, description, or theoretical exposition? "Understanding ecological resilience" is a noble goal, but how does this specific model contribute to it? What kind of understanding will it generate?

**4. No Tie to Primary Results/Success Criteria:** "We expect to see some changes in forest composition over time" is a vague outcome, not a specific criterion for success. How will the authors or readers judge if the model successfully explored or understood anything? What specific graphs or relationships would demonstrate this?

**5. No Testable Patterns:** This is the most significant omission given the updated ODD. There are no specified patterns (observations, trends, general beliefs) that the model should reproduce to demonstrate its realism or utility. What specific changes in forest composition are expected based on empirical data or theory? How will "interesting feedback loops" be identified and verified?

**6. Describes the Model Prematurely:** "The model considers various tree types, their growth, and competition for resources" starts to describe how the model works, which should be reserved for later sections (Entities, State Variables, Processes, etc.). The Purpose section should focus solely on the "why."

**7. Not Specific to This Version:** It doesn't clearly delineate what this particular model aims to achieve versus potential future expansions.

**8. Ambiguous Terms:** "Forest ecosystems," "different species," "various tree types," and "ecological resilience" are all very broad. What specific types of forests, species, or aspects of resilience are being modeled?

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Solution

A significantly improved (but still hypothetical) version might be:

*The purpose of this model is to test the hypothesis that increased frequency and intensity of drought events, driven by climate change, will lead to a shift in temperate forest composition from drought-sensitive coniferous species to more drought-tolerant deciduous species. Specifically, we aim to explain the observed pattern of increasing deciduous tree dominance in the Pacific Northwest region over the last two decades, and to predict the magnitude of this compositional shift by 2050 under IPCC RCP 8.5 climate projections. The model's suitability will be evaluated by its ability to reproduce two key patterns: (1) the observed decline in average growth rates of Douglas Fir following historical drought years, and (2) the pattern of increased seedling establishment of Oak species in areas previously dominated by coniferous trees after severe droughts.*

:::: dg-box
**Task 2: Which of the statements describes the observational patterns correctly?**

(a) "The model shows the detection of daphnia kairomones which induces the VM to mimize predation risk.
(b) "The model reproduces the response of VM to predation risk"

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Solution

\(b\) is correct. The model's purpose is to *explain* the VM patterns using its mechanisms, but the patterns themselves are the observed phenomena.
:::

:::: dg-box
**Task 3:** Select those specific purposes which are too vague and rewrite them (if the context allows you).

1.  The model demonstrates a home range shrinking of caribou with decreasing food availability due to habitat shifts.
2.  Typical stem diameter distributions should be reproduced.
3.  The model predicts the impact of sanitation felling on the spatial pattern on bark beetle infestion on spruce trees in the national park.
4.  The model produces interesting results which are known from systems dynamics.

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
### Solution

1.  and 3. are clear enough to be included in the ODD.
2.  the "typical diameter distribution" should be explicitly stated, e.g., "the J-shape distribution in the regeneration areas; the "u-shape distribution for the mature forest area".
3.  Such statements should be generally avoided.
